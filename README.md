# pyTunes
HackNC 2021 Project

## Setting Up
Once the repo is cloned, install the requirements through `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
Once that is done, edit `configure.py` with your AssemblyAI authorization key.

## First Launch
When you first launch pyTunes, you'll need to login through Spotify in a pop-up. Once that's done, pyTunes is ready to use!

## Usage
You need to use the keyword `play` when speaking. 

Examples: `play pop music`, `play pop`, `play edm`.

## YTMusic
YouTube Music is used as a fallback for if you don't have a Spotify premium account, which Spotify needs you to for these API calls.
